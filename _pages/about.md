I am a MA Candidate in Philosophy at the University of Western Ontario in London, ON. I hold a BA in Mathematics and Computer Science from McGill University in Montreal, QX as well as a BA in Classics and Contemporary Studies with a minor in the History of Science and Technology from the University of King's College in Halifax, NS. My interests include the practice and philosophy of mathematics, physics and computer science; politics and power; ontology; mythology; and much more.
